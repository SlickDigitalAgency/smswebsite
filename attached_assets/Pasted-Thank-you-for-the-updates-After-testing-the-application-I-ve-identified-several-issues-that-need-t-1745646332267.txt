Thank you for the updates. After testing the application, Iâ€™ve identified several issues that need to be addressed. Below is a summary of the findings:

Faculty Page:

The Faculty page loads correctly, but the "Add Faculty" button is currently not functional. Please ensure that the functionality for adding a faculty member is fully implemented.

Classes & Programs Page:

The Classes & Programs page loads as expected, but the following buttons are not functioning:

"Add Program"

"Add Class"

"Add Section"

These buttons need to be fully functional.

Attendance Page:

The Take Attendance and Export Report buttons are not working. Please investigate and resolve the issue.

Fee Management Page:

The "Add Fee Structure" button is not functional.

The "Generate Fee Challan" button is also not working. Both buttons need to be fully functional.

Exams & Results Page:

When clicking on the Exams & Results option in the sidebar, I am getting a 404 Page Not Found error. It appears the page may not be properly routed. Please confirm if the route has been correctly added.

Timetable Page:

Similarly, when selecting the Timetable option from the sidebar, a 404 Page Not Found error is displayed. Please check the routing for this page as well.

Announcements Page:

When clicking on the Announcements option, I encounter a 404 Page Not Found error. It seems this page may also be missing from the router.

Reports Page:

The Reports option leads to a 404 Page Not Found error. Again, please ensure that the route is properly configured.

Import/Export Functionality:

On all pages, the Import and Export buttons are not functional. These need to be fully operational to allow for proper data handling.

Dashboard:

Under Quick Actions, the buttons are not fully functional. Please ensure these buttons are working as expected.

Additionally, please ensure that real-time data is strictly used within the dashboard for accurate and up-to-date information.

Next Steps:
Please review these issues and prioritize fixing them. Let me know once they have been addressed, and I will be happy to re-test the application.
