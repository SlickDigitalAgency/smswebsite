Here’s a professionally written version of your requirements and access control strategy:

### 🔐 Access Control & Role Management Requirements

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - **Strictly remove** all **signup files and functionality** from the application.
   - Only **login** should be allowed to access the system. All users must be created by authorized personnel (e.g., Super Admin or Admin based on permissions).

#### 1. **Super Admin**
- **Full control** over the entire application.
- Can **create and manage Admin users**.
- Can define which permissions an Admin user has, including the ability to manage:
  - Faculty
  - Staff
  - Students
- Can **assign and revoke access rights** to all other roles.
- Can generate a **one-time password (OTP)** for newly created Admins and Staff. The recipient must **reset their password** upon first login.

#### 2. **Admin** *(Permissions controlled by Super Admin)*

### 🔑 Password Management
- When Super Admin or Admin (if permitted) creates a new Staff or Faculty user:
  - A **one-time password (OTP)** is generated and shared securely.
  - On first login, the user is **required to change their password** to continue using the system.
